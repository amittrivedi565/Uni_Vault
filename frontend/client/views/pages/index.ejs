  <h2>Why Choose UniVault?</h2>
  <p>
    Let’s face it — most <span>other study sites</span> are either
    <span>abandoned group projects from 2012</span> or look like they were built
    during a <span>coffee-fueled all-nighter</span>... and never touched again.
    <br /><br />
    <strong>UniVault is different.</strong> We’re <span>alive</span>,
    <span>organized</span>, and <span>actually useful</span>. We make
    <strong>high-quality academic content</strong> easy to find, fun to use, and
    <em>impossible to forget</em>.
